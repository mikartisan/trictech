## TricTech: Advancing TODA Digitalization with Enhanced Emergency Notification using Haversine Algorithm

The "TricTech: Advancing TODA Digitalization with Enhanced Emergency
Notification using Haversine Algorithm" application addressed the problems of
overcharging, bad services, and inaccessibility of drivers in the Mariveles. The target
association, which is the 1834 Brotherhood Transport Multipurpose Cooperative TODA
can fill the gap between drivers and passengers by the developed system. Passengers
are accessible to the nearest drivers based on the location.
